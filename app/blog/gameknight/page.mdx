# GameKnight: A UX Case Study

*Start with a brief, one-sentence summary of the project and its outcome. This is your elevator pitch.*

## The Problem
*Clearly define the user problem you set out to solve. What was the core pain point for users? Why does this product need to exist?*

## My Role
*List your role (e.g., "Product Designer, User Researcher") and your key responsibilities. (e.g., "I was responsible for the entire design process, from initial research and wireframing to high-fidelity prototyping and user testing.")*

## The Process
*This is the most important section. Walk the hiring manager through your design process. Use images and be specific.*

### 1. User Research
*Who are the users? What were their needs and frustrations? Show evidence like key quotes from interviews or summary charts from a survey.*

### 2. Ideation & Design
*Show the messy work! This is where you include images of your user flows, wireframes, and early sketches. Explain *why* you made certain design decisions.*

### 3. Prototyping & Testing
*Showcase your high-fidelity Figma designs. You can even embed an interactive Figma prototype here. What did you learn from user testing? How did you iterate on your design based on feedback?*

## The Final Solution
*Present the final, polished UI screens. Explain how your final design solves the initial user problem.*

## Outcome & Learnings
*What was the result of your work? What did you learn from the project? If you could do it again, what would you do differently?*
