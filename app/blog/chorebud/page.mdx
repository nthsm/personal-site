# ChoreBud: A UX Case Study

*This is a case study on designing a mobile app that gamifies household chores to make them less of a burden for busy young professionals sharing a living space.*

## The Problem
For people living with roommates, managing household chores is a constant source of friction. The mental load of tracking who did what, when, and whose turn it is often leads to arguments, resentment, and an unfair division of labor. Existing solutions like whiteboards are easily ignored, while group chats become cluttered. There was a clear need for a simple, transparent, and even enjoyable way to manage shared responsibilities.

## My Role
As the sole **Product Designer**, I was responsible for the entire end-to-end design process, including **user research**, **wireframing**, **high-fidelity prototyping**, and **usability testing**.

## The Process
My design process was focused on understanding the user's emotional relationship with chores and finding a solution that felt encouraging, not demanding.

### 1. User Research
I started by conducting user interviews with 5 individuals aged 22-30 who live with roommates. I wanted to understand the core of their frustrations.

A key insight came from one interviewee who said:
> "It's not even the cleaning I hate. It's the awkward text messages, the nagging, and feeling like I'm the only one who cares. I just want a fair system."

This revealed that the primary pain point was **communication and accountability**, not the physical work itself.

### 2. Ideation & Design
Based on the research, I focused on three core features: a shared, rotating schedule, a simple "check-off" system, and a points-based rewards system to add a touch of positive reinforcement. I sketched initial user flows and created low-fidelity wireframes in FigJam to map out the core user journey.



### 3. Prototyping & Testing
I developed a high-fidelity, interactive prototype in **Figma**. I then conducted usability testing with 3 target users. The testing revealed a critical flaw: my initial rewards system was too complicated and felt like more work to manage. Users wanted clarity above all else. Based on this feedback, I simplified the feature to a straightforward point system and leaderboard.

## The Final Solution
The final design features a clean, intuitive dashboard that shows each user their upcoming chores for the week. A simple tap allows them to mark a task as complete, notifying their roommates and updating the shared schedule. The simplified leaderboard fosters a sense of friendly competition and shared accomplishment.



## Outcome & Learnings
The final prototype successfully addressed the core user need for a simple and transparent system to manage chores without confrontation. The biggest lesson was the importance of simplifying gamificationâ€”users wanted **clarity and fairness**, not a complex game.

If I were to continue this project, the next step would be to design a more robust onboarding flow to make setting up a new household as seamless as possible.
