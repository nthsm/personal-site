Hey, I'm Nathan Smith. Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm a Product Designer currently completing my Master's in Information Technology at Florida State University, specializing in User-Centered Design, alongside the Google UX Design Professional Certificate.

My journey into design began with a simple belief: that great technology should feel invisible. It should be intuitive, accessible, and built around real human needs. This led me to a B.S. in Management Information Systems and a minor in Computer Science, where I gained a strong technical foundation.

This unique background in data and design, supported by a fluency in web development technologies, allows me to bridge the gap between technical possibilities and human-centered solutions. It means I can design with a deep understanding of the entire product lifecycle, from initial concept to final implementation.

Outside of design, I spend my time tinkering, exploring, and riding far distances on my gravel bike or rugged trails on my mountain bike. I still make music from time to time as well, and I'm a proud owner of the DFAM and Mother-32 analog synths.

I have a deep-seated curiosity for knowing why something works the way it does, and I’m always wondering if it can be done better. This drive to explore, understand, and improve is at the core of who I am, both in my hobbies and in my design work.

Below, you’ll find a gallery of my adventures. If you'd like to see more or learn more about me, follow me on Instagram. If you want to know more about my work experience, you can view a copy of my resume on LinkedIn. You can also connect with me on Strava—I'd love to see your favorite routes!
