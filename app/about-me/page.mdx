Hey, I'm Nathan Smith. Welcome to my little corner of the internet.

I'm a Product Designer currently completing my Master's in Information Technology at Florida State University, specializing in User-Centered Design, alongside the Google UX Design Professional Certificate.

My journey into design began with a simple belief: that great technology should feel invisible. It should be intuitive, accessible, and built around real human needs. This led me to a B.S. in Management Information Systems and a minor in Computer Science, where I gained a strong technical foundation. While I initially planned a career in data analysis, I realized that my true passion wasn't just in finding patterns, but in using those insights to build better systems that serve people first.

This unique background in both data and design allows me to bridge the gap between technical possibilities and human-centered solutions.

Outside of design, I spend my time tinkering, exploring, and riding far distances on my gravel bike or rugged trails on my mountain bike. I have a deep-seated curiosity for knowing why something works the way it does, and I’m always wondering if it can be done better. This drive to explore, understand, and improve is at the core of who I am, both on the bike and in my design work.

Below, you’ll find a gallery of my projects and adventures. If you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat, feel free to get in touch. You can also connect with me on Strava—I'd love to see your favorite routes!
